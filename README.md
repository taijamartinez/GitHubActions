## Description

This full-stack application presents a 10-question quiz to users, tracks their score, and displays results. For this project, my focus was implementing a complete CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions** and **Render** for automated testing and deployment.


## Screenshots

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/taijamartinez/GitHubActions`.

2. Navigate into the project directory:
`cd mern-quiz-app`.

3. Install backend dependencies:
`cd server` then `npm install`.

4. Install frontend dependencies:
`cd ../client` then `npm install`.

5. Set up environment variables:
In /server, create a .env file and include:

`MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<your-username>:<your-password>@cluster0.ucgbjnl.mongodb.net/techquiz?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0`.

6. Run both servers:
`npm run develop`



## Usage

1. Open the app and click Start Quiz.

2. Answer each question before the timer runs out.

3. View your final score at the end.

4. Developers can manage quiz data via the backend API.
